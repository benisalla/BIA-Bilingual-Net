BIALinguaNet uses powerful Transformer architectures to provide a reliable language translation system. Designed with simplicity and effectiveness in mind, this project makes it easier to develop neural networks for natural language processing, suitable for both academic research and practical use.

The model is versatile, allowing adjustments to meet various language and translation needs. By changing the transformer's input settings and the formats of the data being translated, users can customize the system to fit their specific requirements.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of components such as data processing, model architecture, and training scripts.
- **Interactive Translation Demo**: Enables real-time testing of translation capabilities.
- **Download Capability**: Allows users to download translated texts.
- **Customizable**: Easily adapt the architecture and data pipelines for different language pairs.
- **Poetry for Dependency Management**: Utilizes Poetry for straightforward and dependable package management.
