BIALinguaNet uses powerful Transformer architectures to provide a reliable language translation system. Designed with simplicity and effectiveness in mind, this project makes it easier to develop neural networks for natural language processing, suitable for both academic research and practical use.

The model is versatile, allowing adjustments to meet various language and translation needs. By changing the transformer's input settings and the formats of the data being translated, users can customize the system to fit their specific requirements.

## Features

- **Bilingual Translation**: Supports translation between English and Darija, allowing users to switch seamlessly between the two languages.
- **Adjustable Model Settings**: Users can fine-tune the translation output by adjusting parameters such as temperature, top-k sampling, top-p sampling, beam size, and length normalization coefficient.
- **Real-time Translation**: Provides immediate translation results with an interactive interface that displays both the input and output texts.
- **Multiple Hypotheses Display**: Shows alternative translation hypotheses with associated confidence scores, giving users a range of translation options.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The app features a visually appealing and intuitive design, making it easy for users to interact with the translation tool.
- **Customizable Translation Settings**: Allows users to control the translation process in detail, tailoring the output to their specific needs.

### Translation Examples

Below are demonstrations of translations performed by the BIALinguaNet model, showcasing its capabilities for both English to Darija (En to Dr) and Darija to English (Dr to En) translations.

#### Scripts Used for Generating Examples:

```
def translate_all(sentences, model, tokenizer):

    translations = []
    for sentence in sentences:
        best_hypo, _ = model.translate(
            sx=sentence,
            tokenizer=tokenizer,
            temperature=1.0,  
            beam_size=4,
            len_norm_coeff=0.6,
            top_k=50,
            top_p=0.95,
            is_ltr=False,
            max_beam_fork=128
        )
        translations.append((sentence, best_hypo))
    return translations

def display_translations(translated_pairs):
    HEADER = '\033[95m'
    OKBLUE = '\033[94m'
    OKGREEN = '\033[92m'
    ENDC = '\033[0m'
    BOLD = '\033[1m'

    print(HEADER + BOLD + "Translations" + ENDC)
    for darija, english in translated_pairs:
        print(f"{OKBLUE}Darija:{ENDC} {darija.ljust(30)} {OKGREEN}English:{ENDC} {english}")

```
